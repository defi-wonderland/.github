We're a group of developers, researchers, and data scientists with one thing in common: we all love building cool sh*t. [DeFi sucks](https://defi.sucks/), but we are here to make it better.

Our mission is to discover, partner with, and empower innovators to create open, permissionless, decentralized financial solutions. We pledge to stand by our partners, working with and supporting them in every way possible.

Weâ€™re partners with some of the most relevant and successful protocols in web3, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext, Yearn, Reflexer, and more.
